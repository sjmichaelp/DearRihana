           You're always working hard and you've always been a strong person
        </div>
        <div id="display_text6">
           If I ever needed someone to get something done, I know I could trust you
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text7">
           (Don't worry I'm too unorganized to plan something and ask you to get something done)<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text8">
           Which is my next point, You are very organized...<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text9">
          If I ever needed someone to organize something, I know I could trust you<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text10">
           (Don't worry I'm not thoughtful enough to think of something to organize)<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text11">
           Which is my next point, You are very thoughtful...<br>

        </div>
        <div id="display_text13">
            (Don't worry I don't have enough friends to host fun party games)
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text14">
            Which is my next point, You are a very good host...<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text15">
            Whenever we needed a place to host sundown, you always welcomed us in your beautiful home<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text16">
            (Which I visited several times to hangout with your mom without your knowledge)<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text17">
            Which is my next point, Your mom is very nice...<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text18">
           (I guess it has nothing to do with you, but she seriously makes the best food.)<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text19">
            Which brings me to my last point, You're very inclusive<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text20">

        </div>
        <div id="display_text21">
            I hope you realize how amazing you are, atleast in my eyes<br>
        </div>
        <div  id="display_text22">
            (You're probably more amazing in other people's eyes)<br>
        </div>
        <div id="display_text23">
